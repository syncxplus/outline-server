# Script to install a shadowbox docker container, a watchtower docker container
# (to automatically update shadowbox), and to create a new shadowbox user.

# You may set the following environment variables, overriding their defaults:
# SB_IMAGE: Shadowbox Docker image to install, e.g. quay.io/outline/shadowbox:nightly
# SB_API_PORT: The port number of the management API.
# SHADOWBOX_DIR: Directory for persistent Shadowbox state.
# SB_PUBLIC_IP: The public IP address for Shadowbox.
# ACCESS_CONFIG: The location of the access config text file.
# SB_DEFAULT_SERVER_NAME: Default name for this server, e.g. "Outline server New York".
#     This name will be used for the server until the admins updates the name
#     via the REST API.
# SENTRY_LOG_FILE: File for writing logs which may be reported to Sentry, in case
#     of an install error. No PII should be written to this file. Intended to be set
#     only by do_install_server.sh.
# WATCHTOWER_REFRESH_SECONDS: refresh interval in seconds to check for updates,
#     defaults to 3600.

# Requires curl and docker to be installed
